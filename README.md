## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: I have used normal html css to do this challenge**

### What I learned

This section I wont say heavily but used a little bit of Css flex-box property which i learn the most.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Used some new tag</h1>
 <picture>
      <img class="qr__code" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qrCode">
  </picture>
```
